# HashIsh

- A [Hashie::Mash](https://github.com/intridea/hashie#mash) knockoff
- This is a prototype
- Built and tested with Ruby 2.2.3

## Setup

Add it to your Gemfile or...

```
gem install hash_ish
```

## Usage

1.  Insert hash

```
hash     = { a { b: "c"} }
hash_ish = HashIsh.new(hash)
```

2.  Access hash keys with method calls

```
hash_ish.a.b # returns 'c'

## Known issues

- currently only supports hash keys that would be valid method names

```
# this works
HashIsh.new(foo: "bar").foo # bar

# this blows up
HashIsh.new(123 => 456)
```
